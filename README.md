# Akka Java Tutorials

The intention of this series is make people aware of various cool tools Akka has developed over the years.
<br />
Even though the documentation of Akka is quite comprehensive I feel it requires quite a lot of effort to get going and start using these tools in the application. And also when you search for any implementation codes we usually end up getting Scala pieces. Very rarely we get something in Java.
<br />
To overcome this I have started this to help people with sample akka code which they can quickly integrate in their applications and enjoy these really cool and powerfull tools.
